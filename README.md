**Q-Learning (RL) : Maze Solving**

This project is a Maze Game developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence course during my B.Sc. studies.
It demonstrates Q-Learning, a fundamental Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, applied to solve a maze using C#. 
The agent learns to navigate through the maze and find the optimal path by maximizing its cumulative rewards.

__Features__

Q-Learning Algorithm: Implements Q-Learning to train an agent in solving maze-based problems.

Maze Simulation: Visual representation of the maze with real-time updates of the agentâ€™s movements.

Customizable Parameters: Adjustable learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to experiment with different configurations.

__Technologies Used__

C# for implementing the Q-Learning algorithm.

Windows Forms for the graphical user interface and maze visualization.
